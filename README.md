## IT Academy Node.js - Setup Sprint

Welcome to our Node.js Bootcamp! We are thrilled to have you join us on this exciting journey to becoming proficient in Node.js. Throughout this bootcamp, you will gain hands-on experience and develop the skills necessary to build robust and scalable applications using Node.js.

### Purpose of the Setup Sprint

The purpose of this setup sprint is to provide you with the essential tools and knowledge that will be used in subsequent sprints. These tools are a curated collection of resources widely adopted in the industry. While they are not the only tools available, our experience has shown that they provide immense value to both beginners and professional developers alike. 

In this setup sprint, you will:
- Install Node.js and understand the importance of using Node Version Manager (NVM)
- Get context about the Node.js runtime and its applications
- Set up your development environment with Visual Studio Code (VSCode) and recommended extensions
- Configure Node.js to work with TypeScript, Prettier, ESLint, and JEST
- Understand what is expected from you in future sprints

## 2. Context and Background

### Introduction to Node.js

Node.js is a powerful JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It allows developers to use JavaScript for server-side scripting, enabling the creation of dynamic web pages before the page is sent to the user's web browser. Node.js is known for its non-blocking, event-driven architecture, making it ideal for building scalable network applications.

### Brief History and Evolution

Node.js was created in 2009 by Ryan Dahl, aiming to create web applications with real-time, push capability. Since then, it has evolved rapidly and is now widely used in the industry. Understanding its history helps appreciate the design choices and community that shaped it.
