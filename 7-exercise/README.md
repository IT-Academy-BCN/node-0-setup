# Algorithmic Exercise: Palindrome Checker

Welcome to the algorithmic exercise! This task is designed to test your understanding and application of various technologies and best practices discussed in the bootcamp.

## Exercise Description

Your task is to create a project from scratch that checks if a given string is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequences of characters that reads the same forward and backward (ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization).

### Example

- "racecar" is a palindrome.
- "RaceCar" is a palindrome (case-insensitive).
- "A man, a plan, a canal, Panama!" is a palindrome (ignoring spaces and punctuation).

## Requirements

Ensure that your project includes the following:

1. **Same Version of Node.js**
   - Make sure you are using the same version of Node.js as specified by the bootcamp guidelines.

2. **Include Required Dependencies**
   - All necessary dependencies and devDependencies must be included in the `package.json` file.

3. **Tests**
   - Write comprehensive tests using Jest to ensure your palindrome checker works correctly.

4. **Proper TypeScript Setup**
   - Include a `tsconfig.json` file with appropriate TypeScript configuration.

5. **Proper ESLint Setup**
   - Include a `.eslintrc.json` file with the required ESLint configuration.

6. **Proper Prettier Setup**
   - Include a `.prettierrc` file with the required Prettier configuration.

## Implementation Guidelines

1. **Function Definition**
   - Write a function `isPalindrome` that takes a string as input and returns a boolean indicating whether the string is a palindrome.

2. **Handle Edge Cases**
   - Your function should handle various edge cases, including empty strings, case insensitivity, and ignoring non-alphanumeric characters.

3. **Write Tests**
   - Write tests to verify your implementation with different cases such as:
     - Simple palindromes
     - Case-insensitive palindromes
     - Palindromes with spaces and punctuation
     - Non-palindromes

## Example Files

- **`src/index.ts`**: Implement your `isPalindrome` function here.
- **`src/index.test.ts`**: Write your Jest tests here.

## Submission

Submit your project by providing a link to your GitHub repository. Ensure that all configurations and dependencies are properly set up so that the project can be cloned and run on any machine without additional setup.

## Evaluation Criteria

Your project will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

- Correctness of the algorithm
- Code quality and adherence to best practices
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Proper setup and configuration of TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier, and Jest

Good luck with your algorithmic exercise!

Happy coding!
