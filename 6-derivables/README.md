## Derivables

To ensure consistency and quality across all sprints, each derivable must include the following:

1. **Same Version of Node.js**
   - Ensure you use the indicated Node.js version.

2. **Include Required Dependencies**
   - All necessary dependencies and devDependencies must be included in the `package.json` file.

3. **Tests**
   - Include comprehensive tests using Jest.

4. **Proper TypeScript Setup**
   - Include a `tsconfig.json` file with appropriate TypeScript configuration.

5. **Proper ESLint Setup**
   - Include a `.eslintrc.json` file with the required ESLint configuration.

6. **Proper Prettier Setup**
   - Include a `.prettierrc` file with the required Prettier configuration.

By following these requirements, we ensure that all derivables maintain a high standard of quality and consistency.

Happy coding!
